# MinGW Dosbox Build Notes
#
# * MinGW redistributable files must be in the PATH while compiling and while
# running a MinGW Dosbox. (SDL.dll, libpng.dll, zlib1.dll, etc.)
#
# * The MinGW PNG package does not currently bundle the libpng.dll.a static
# library, which means that a MinGW Dosbox cannot be statically compiled using
# distro packages.
#
# Use this environment for building a 64-bit MinGW Dosbox on Cygwin:

TRIPLET=x86_64-w64-mingw32
export PATH="/usr/$TRIPLET/sys-root/mingw/bin:$PATH"
export CC="$TRIPLET-gcc"
export CXX="$TRIPLET-g++"

# autoreconf && ./configure && make

TODO:

Write a Linux-based utility
- To load this font
- Render ANEX86.BMP with it using Freetype

Except that it should be called FREECG98.BMP,
and DOSBox-X should look for it if ANEX86.BMP does not exist.

The reason I won't build it into DOSBox-X is that users may
not care about PC-98 emulation and would not want to waste
the space (or see the main EXE bloat by 512KB to hold it).
